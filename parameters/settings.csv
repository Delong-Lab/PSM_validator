Precursor mass tolerance (+/- ppm) [10],pre_mz_tol,10,Should be based on the mass accuracy of the instrument.
Product ion mass tolerance (+/- ppm) [20],pro_mz_tol,20,Should be based on the mass accuracy of the instrument.
Product ion abundance threshold (noise threshold for scoring and PCC calculation) [500],abund_thresh,500,Product ion abundance threshold should be based on typical MS/MS noise level for the mass spectrometer used. 
Product ion abundance threshold for PCC calculation (% of max) [10],PCC_abund_thresh,10,"The abundance threshold for PCC calculation allows for exclusion of peaks that are not noise but are minor peaks in the spectra. Including multiple relatively small peaks can ""buffer"" the PCC, leading to high PCC values that do not reflect large differences in more prominent peaks. For inclusion of a peak in calculation of the PCC, at least one value in the intensity pair for that peak (the intensity in the biological spectrum or the intensity in the validation spectrum) must exceed both the regular abundance threshold (noise threshold) and the PCC abundance threshold. The horizontal dotted line in the mirror plot generated by PSM_validator corresponds to whichever abundance threshold is higher for the given analysis."
Minimum allowable % backbone coverage [30],min_score,30,"Backbone coverage refers to the percentage of peptide bonds in the sequence that are represented by fragment ions in the observed spectrum. A backbone coverage of 100% indicates that the fragmentation spectrum provides direct evidence for the entire amino acid sequence of the peptide. If coverage of a region of the backbone is missing, the spectrum provides less certainty of the precise sequence in that region. "
Minimum allowable % b/y (or % c/z) intensity [20],min_weighted_score,20,"If multiple spectra provide the same backbone coverage, the algorithm selects the spectrum in which the summed intensity of all the backbone coverage ions accounts for the highest percentage of the total ion signal in the spectrum (% b/y or % c/z intensity). The precursor C-12 peak is excluded from the calculation of the total ion signal."
Minimum number of pairs for PCC calculation [10],min_pairs_PCC,10,Defining a minimum number of pairs for PCC calculation ensures that the assesment of similarity is based on more than just a small number of peaks. 
Window size for precursor extraction during RT determination (+/- minutes) [0.6],RTtol,0.6,Window size for precursor extraction should be based on typical peak width for the system used. 
Minimum number of internal standards for percentile calculation [15],min_intstd,15,Defines the minimum number of internal standard values required for determining the PCC prediction interval and the delta RT prediction interval. 
Minimum allowable percentile (%) [5],percentile_thresh,5,"For the query, the minimum percentile that is required for a passing result. A higher percentile threshold is more stringent. For example, a threshold of 5% would require that the query PCC fall within the 95% prediction interval for the query to receive a result of ""PASS"". A threshold of 10% would require that the query PCC fall within the 90% prediction interval. If the percentile for the query PCC is 7.6%, for example, the query PCC is higher than the PCC for 7.6% of true (valid) matches (determined by calculating a normal distribution based on the PCC values for the internal standard peptides). This PCC falls within the 95% prediction interval but not the 90% prediction interval; thus, the query would receive a result of ""PASS"" if the percentile threshold was set at 5% but not if it was set at 10%. This threshold applies to both the PCC analysis and delta RT analysis."
